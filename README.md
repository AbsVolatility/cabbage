# Cabbage

Cabbage is an esoteric, cabbage-oriented (and still developing) language.
This implementation is written in Python 3.3 with the help of [PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/).

## Esoteric, cabbage-oriented language?

An [esoteric programming language](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) is "designed to experiment with weird ideas, to be hard to program in, or as a joke, rather than for practical use". This particular esoteric language (esolang for short) has been designed to experiment with "cabbage-oriented programming".

Cabbage-oriented programming revolves around the idea of "cabbages". Each cabbage has a set of "leaves", which are properties of the cabbage - much like objects with attributes in object-oriented programming. However, these leaves cannot do anything apart from hold information - all processes must be apart from the cabbages, in functions on their own.

## Development

As stated above, the language has only begun to spring from the ground, and is far from complete. An IDE is in development.

## Alright, so how do I use it?

First, make sure you have Python 3.x installed, along with PLY (use the link above). Download the files, run the "cabbage.py" program, and input `interpreter()` into the Python shell.

To run a complete program, run the "cabbage.py" program, but instead input `run(<filename>)`, replacing `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to run.
